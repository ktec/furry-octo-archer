Rightly or wrongly, this application scrapes the public internet and joins
the dots. All information used is already in the public domain, but disjointed.
We just bring it all together to provide some illumination. We did it because
it was fun, not because we're in the business of spying on people. There's
already enough people doing that without us joining in. The truth is though,
this data, in its illuminated state is actually quite valuable to some people
and providing those people have reasonably* good intentions we're willing to
exchange our time for money, like the rest of the world. That means, the data
here is for sale. If you have an interest in the contents, get in touch, we'd
like to talk to you.
